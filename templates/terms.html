        <p>Welcome to crimbot! To start chatting with the bot, please familiarize yourself with some information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The bot may generate content that is offensive. Use at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Do not give the bot any personally identifiable information, as it models its responses after the messages it receives.</li>
            <li>Remember to not take anything the bot says seriously. It can make stuff up, contradict itself or claim it is a real person.</li>
            <li>We store cookies in your browser to keep track of which messages belong to which conversation. The message data you submit in itself does not contain any personally identifiable information.</li>
            <li>The experiment lasts until October 5th, 2023. After that date, the site will be gone. Enjoy it while you still can.</li>
        </ul>
